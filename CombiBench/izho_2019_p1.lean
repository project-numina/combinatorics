Prove that there are at least 100! ways to partition the number 100! into summands from the set $\\{1!, 2!, 3!, \\ldots, 99!\\}$. (Partitions differing in the order of summands are considered the same; any summand can be taken multiple times. We remind that $n!=1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n$.)

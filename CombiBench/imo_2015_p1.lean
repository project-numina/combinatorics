We say that a finite set $\mathcal{S}$ in the plane is balanced if, for any two different points $A$, $B$ in $\mathcal{S}$, there is a point $C$ in $\mathcal{S}$ such that $AC=BC$. We say that $\mathcal{S}$ is centre-free if for any three points $A$, $B$, $C$ in $\mathcal{S}$, there is no point $P$ in $\mathcal{S}$ such that $PA=PB=PC$. (1) Show that for all integers $n\geq 3$, there exists a balanced set consisting of $n$ points. (1) Determine all integers $n\geq 3$ for which there exists a balanced centre-free set consisting of $n$ points.

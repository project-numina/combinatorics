The liarâ€™s guessing game is a game played between two players A and B. The rules of the game depend on two positive integers $k$ and $n$ which are known to both players. At the start of the game the player A chooses integers $x$ and $N$ with $1 \le x \le N$. Player A keeps $x$ secret, and truthfully tells $N$ to the player B. The player B now tries to obtain information about $x$ by asking player A questions as follows: each question consists of B specifying an arbitrary set $S$ of positive integers (possibly one specified in some previous question), and asking A whether $x$ belongs to $S$. Player B may ask as many questions as he wishes. After each question, player A must immediately answer it with yes or no, but is allowed to lie as many times as she wants; the only restriction is that, among any $k+1$ consecutive answers, at least one answer must be truthful. After B has asked as many questions as he wants, he must specify a set $X$ of at most $n$ positive integers. If $x \in X$, then B wins; otherwise, he loses. Prove that: (a) If $n \ge 2^k$ then B has a winning strategy. (b) There exists a positive integer $k_0$ such that for every $k \ge k_0$ there exists an integer $n \ge 1.99^k$ for which B cannot guarantee a victory.

/--
There are $4n$ pebbles of weights $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 4n$. Each pebble is colored in one of $n$ colors and there are four pebbles of each color. Show that we can arrange the pebbles into two piles so that the following two conditions are both satisfied: 1) The total weights of both piles are the same. 2) Each pile contains two pebbles of each color.

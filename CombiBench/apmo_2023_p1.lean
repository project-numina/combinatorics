Let $n \\geq 5$ be an integer. Consider $n$ squares with side lengths $1,2, \\ldots, n$, respectively. The squares are arranged in the plane with their sides parallel to the $x$ and $y$ axes. Suppose that no two squares touch, except possibly at their vertices.\nShow that it is possible to arrange these squares in a way such that every square touches exactly two other squares.

Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $X_{n}$ be the set of $n$ ! permutations of ${1,2, \ldots, n}$.
Let $\pi$ and $\sigma$ be two permutations in $X_{n}$, and define $\pi \leq \sigma$ provided that the
set of inversions of $\pi$ is a subset of the set of inversions of $\sigma$. Verify that this defines
a partial order on $X_{n}$, called the inversion poset.
Describe the cover relation for this partial order and then draw the diagram for the inversion poset $\left(H_{4}, \leq\right)$.-/

You are given a set of $n$ blocks, each weighing at least 1; their total weight is $2 n$. Prove that for every real number $r$ with $0 \\leqslant r \\leqslant 2 n-2$ you can choose a subset of the blocks whose total weight is at least $r$ but at most $r+2$.

    (n : ℕ)
    (blocks : Fin n → ℝ)
    (h1 : ∀ i, blocks i ≥ 1)
    (h2 : ∑ i, blocks i = 2 * n) :
    ∀ r : ℝ, 0 ≤ r ∧ r ≤ 2 * n - 2 →
    ∃ (s : Finset (Fin n)),
    (∑ i ∈ s, blocks i) ≥ r ∧ (∑ i ∈ s, blocks i) ≤ r + 2 := by

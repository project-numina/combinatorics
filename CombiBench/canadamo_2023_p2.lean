There are 20 students in a high school class, and each student has exactly three close friends in the class. Five of the students have bought tickets to an upcoming concert. If any student sees that at least two of their close friends have bought tickets, then they will buy a ticket too.\n\nIs it possible that the entire class buys tickets to the concert?\n(Assume that friendship is mutual; if student $A$ is close friends with student $B$, then $B$ is close friends with $A$.)

Let $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ be distinct positive integers and let $M$ be a set of $n-1$ positive integers not containing $s=a_1+a_2+\ldots+a_n$. A grasshopper is to jump along the real axis, starting at the point $0$ and making $n$ jumps to the right with lengths $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ in some order. Prove that the order can be chosen in such a way that the grasshopper never lands on any point in $M$.

For all positive integers $n, k$, let $f(n, 2k)$ be the number of ways an $n \\times 2k$ board can be fully covered by $nk$ dominoes of size $2 \\times 1$. (For example, $f(2,2)=2$ and $f(3,2)=3$.)\nFind all positive integers $n$ such that for every positive integer $k$, the number $f(n, 2k)$ is odd.

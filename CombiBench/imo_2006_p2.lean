Let $P$ be a regular 2006-gon. A diagonal of $P$ is called good if its endpoints divide the boundary of $P$ into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of $P$. The sides of $P$ are also called good. Suppose $P$ has been dissected into triangles by 2003 diagonals, no two of which have a common point in the interior of $P$. Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration.

imo_2017_p3,"A hunter and an invisible rabbit play a game in the Euclidean plane. The rabbit's starting point, $A_0$, and the hunter's starting point, $B_0$, are the same. After $n-1$ rounds of the game, the rabbit is at point $A_{n-1}$ and the hunter is at point $B_{n-1}$. In the nth round of the game, three things occur in order. (i) The rabbit moves invisibly to a point $A_n$ such that the distance between $A_{n-1}$ and $A_n$ is exactly 1. (ii) A tracking device reports a point $P_n$ to the hunter. The only guarantee provided by the tracking device is that the distance between $P_n$ and $A_n$ is at most 1. (iii) The hunter moves visibly to a point $B_n$ such that the distance between $B_{n-1}$ and $B_n$ is exactly 1. Is it always possible, no matter how the rabbit moves, and no matter what points are reported by the tracking device, for the hunter to choose her moves so that after $10^9$ rounds she can ensure that the distance between her and the rabbit is at most 100?",imo

Amy and Ben take turns placing stones with Amy going first. On her turn, Amy places a new red stone on an unoccupied site such that the distance between any two sites occupied by red stones is not equal to $\sqrt{5}$. On his turn, Ben places a new blue stone on any unoccupied site. (A site occupied by a blue stone is allowed to be at any distance from any other occupied site.)

imo_2019_p3,"A social network has $2019$ users, some pairs of whom are friends. Whenever user $A$ is friends with user $B$, user $B$ is also friends with user $A$. Events of the following kind may happen repeatedly, one at a time: Three users $A$, $B$, and $C$ such that $A$ is friends with both $B$ and $C$, but $B$ and $C$ are not friends, change their friendship statuses such that $B$ and $C$ are now friends, but $A$ is no longer friends with $B$, and no longer friends with $C$. All other friendship statuses are unchanged. Initially, $1010$ users have $1009$ friends each, and $1009$ users have $1010$ friends each. Prove that there exists a sequence of such events after which each user is friends with at most one other user.",imo
imo_2019_p5,"The Bank of Bath issues coins with an $H$ on one side and a $T$ on the other. Harry has $n$ of these coins arranged in a line from left to right. He repeatedly performs the following operation: If there are exactly $k > 0$ coins showing $H$, then he turns over the $k^{th}$ coin from the left; otherwise, all coins show $T$ and he stops. For example, if $n = 3$ the process starting with the configuration $THT$ would be $THT \rightarrow HHT \rightarrow HTT \rightarrow TTT$, which stops after three operations. (a) Show that, for each initial configuration, Harry stops after a finite number of operations. (b) For each initial configuration $C$, let $L(C)$ be the number of operations before Harry stops. For example, $L(THT) = 3$ and $L(TTT) = 0$. Determine the average value of $L(C)$ over all $2^n$ possible initial configurations $C$.",imo

Each of two cable car companies, $A$ and $B$, operates $k$ cable cars; each cable car provides a transfer from one of the stations to a higher one (with no intermediate stops). The $k$ cable cars of $A$ have $k$ different starting points and $k$ different finishing points, and a cable car that starts higher also finishes higher. The same conditions hold for $B$. We say that two stations are linked by a company if one can start from the lower station and reach the higher one by using one or more cars of that company (no other movements between stations are allowed). Determine the smallest positive integer k for which one can guarantee that there are two stations that are linked by both companies.",imo

Jumpy numbers the walnuts from 1 through 2021, and digs 2021 little holes in a circular pattern in the ground around their favourite tree. The next morning Jumpy notices that Bushy had placed one walnut into each hole, but had paid no attention to the numbering. Unhappy, Jumpy decides to reorder the walnuts by performing a sequence of 2021 moves. In the $k$-th move, Jumpy swaps the positions of the two walnuts adjacent to walnut $k$. Prove that there exists a value of $k$ such that, on the $k$-th move, Jumpy swaps some walnuts $a$ and $b$ such that $a < k < b$.",imo
imo_2022_p1,"The Bank of Oslo issues two types of coin: aluminium (denoted A) and bronze (denoted B). Marianne has $n$ aluminium coins and $n$ bronze coins, arranged in a row in some arbitrary initial order. A chain is any subsequence of consecutive coins of the same type. Given a fixed positive integer $k\le 2n$, Marianne repeatedly performs the following operation: she identifies the longest chain containing the $k^{th}$ coin from the left, and moves all coins in that chain to the left end of the row. For example, if $n = 4$ and $k = 4$, the process starting from the ordering AABBBABA would be $AABBBABA \rightarrow BBBAAABA \rightarrow AAABBBBA \rightarrow BBBBAAAA \rightarrow BBBBAAAA \rightarrow \ldots$. Find all pairs $(n, k)$ with $1 \le k \le 2n$ such that for every initial ordering, at some moment during the process, the leftmost $n$ coins will all be of the same type.",imo

imo_2024_p5,"Turbo the snail plays a game on a board with 2024 rows and 2023 columns. There are hidden monsters in 2022 of the cells. Initially, Turbo does not know where any of the monsters are, but he knows that there is exactly one monster in each row except the first row and the last row, and that each column contains at most one monster. Turbo makes a series of attempts to go from the first row to the last row. On each attempt, he chooses to start on any cell in the first row, then repeatedly moves to an adjacent cell sharing a common side. (He is allowed to return to a previously visited cell.) If he reaches a cell with a monster, his attempt ends and he is transported back to the first row to start a new attempt. The monsters do not move, and Turbo remembers whether or not each cell he has visited contains a monster. If he reaches any cell in the last row, his attempt ends and the game is over. Determine the minimum value of $n$ for which Turbo has a strategy that guarantees reaching the last row on the $n^{th}$ attempt or earlier, regardless of the locations of the monsters.",imo

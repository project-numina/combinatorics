Let $n$ be a positive integer. A Japanese triangle consists of $1 + 2 + \dots + n$ circles arranged in an equilateral triangular shape such that for each $i = 1$, $2$, $\dots$, $n$, the $i^{th}$ row contains exactly $i$ circles, exactly one of which is coloured red. A ninja path in a Japanese triangle is a sequence of $n$ circles obtained by starting in the top row, then repeatedly going from a circle to one of the two circles immediately below it and finishing in the bottom row. In terms of $n$, find the greatest $k$ such that in each Japanese triangle there is a ninja path containing at least $k$ red circles.

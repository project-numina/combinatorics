Addition Principle: Suppose that a set S is partitioned into pairwise disjoint parts $S_1,S_2,
\ldots, S_m$. The number of objects in S can be determined by finding the number of objects in each
of the parts, and adding the numbers so obtained:  $|S| = |S_1| + |S_2| + \cdots + |S_m|$.

/-
Multiplication Principle: Let S be a set of ordered pairs (a, b) of objects, where the first object
a comes from a set of size p, and for each choice of object a there are q choices for object b. Then
the size of S is p x q.

Subtraction Principle: Let A be a set and let U be a larger set containing A. Let $\overline{A} = U
\setminus A = \{ x \in U : x \notin A \}$ be the complement of A in U. Then the number |A| of
objects in A is given by the rule: |A| = |U| - |$\overline{A}$|.

Division Principle. Let S be a finite set that is partitioned into k parts in such a way that each
part contains the same number of objects. Then the number of parts in the partition is given by the
rule: k = $\frac{|S|}{\text{number of objects in a part}}$.

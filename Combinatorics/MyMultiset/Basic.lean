# Multisets

This file defines multisets, which are possibly infinite collections of objects that may contain
duplicates.

The main definition is `MyMultiset α` is a wrapper around a function `rep : α → ℕ∞` that
represents the number of each `a : α` if a multiset contains infinitely many `a` then `rep a = ⊤`.

Note that we allow `rep a = 0` which means that `a` is not in the multiset.

A multiset on `α` is a possibly infinite collection of objects, with duplicates allowed.

If `α` is a finite type with cardinality `k` , then a multiset on `α` is said to have `k` type of
objects. If we want to define a multiset with `k` type of objects, an obvious choice is to use
`α = Fin k`.

If `S` is a multiset on `β` and `f : α → β` is a function, then `f⁻¹(S)` is the multiset on `α`
given by for each `a : α`, the number of `a` in `f⁻¹(S)` is the number of `f a` in `S`.

If `S` is a multiset on `α ⊕ β`, then `S` can be split into two multisets on `α` and `β`
respectively.

In particular, if `S` is a multiset with `m + n` types of objects, then `S` can be split into two
multisets with `m` and `n` types of objects respectively.

If `S` is a multiset on `Option α`, then `S` can be split into two multisets on `α` and `PUnit`.

This corresponds to the fact that if `S` is a multiset with `n + 1` types of objects, then `S` can
be split into two multisets with `n` and `1` types of objects respectively.

If `S` is a multiset with `n + 1` types of objects {a₁, ..., aₙ, aₙ₊₁}, then `S.single` is the

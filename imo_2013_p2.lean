A configuration of $4027$ points in the plane is called Colombian if it consists of $2013$ red points and $2014$ blue points, and no three points in the configuration are collinear. By drawing some lines, the plane is divided into several regions.
An arrangement of lines is considered *good* for a Colombian configuration if the following two conditions are satisfied:
(1) No line passes through any point in the configuration.
(2) No region contains points of both colors.
Find the smallest integer $k$ such that for any Colombian configuration of $4027$ points, there exists a good arrangement of $k$ lines.

theorem imo_2013_p2 :
  -- Given finite sets of red and blue points
  ∀ (R B : Set (ℤ × ℤ)) (hR : Set.Finite R) (hB : Set.Finite B)
  -- The numbers of red and blue points
  (hR_card : Nat.card R = 2013) (hB_card : Nat.card B = 2014)
  -- Condition: No three points are collinear, i.e., the cross product of vectors is nonzero
  (h_no_collinear : ∀ p ∈ R ∪ B, ∀ q ∈ R ∪ B, ∀ r ∈ R ∪ B, p ≠ q → p ≠ r → q ≠ r →
    let v1 := (q.1 - p.1, q.2 - p.2)
    let v2 := (r.1 - p.1, r.2 - p.2)
    v1.1 * v2.2 ≠ v1.2 * v2.1),
  -- Conclusion: There exists a set of 2013 lines
  ∃ (L : Finset (ℤ × ℤ × ℤ)) (hL : L.card = 2013),
  -- Each line does not pass through any given point
  (∀ l ∈ L, ∀ p ∈ R ∪ B, match l, p with
    | (a, b, c), (x, y) => a * x + b * y + c ≠ 0) ∧
  -- Each region contains only points of a single color: Red and blue points are separated by the lines
  (∀ p ∈ R, ∀ q ∈ B, ∀ l ∈ L, match l, p, q with
    | (a, b, c), (x, y), (x', y') => (a * x + b * y + c > 0 ∧ a * x' + b * y' + c < 0) ∨
                                     (a * x + b * y + c < 0 ∧ a * x' + b * y' + c > 0)) := by sorry
